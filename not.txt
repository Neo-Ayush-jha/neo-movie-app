      "description": "At first sight of Elizabeth Van Vorst, Hallock loses interest in her cousin, Amanda, whom he professed to love. Bereft of parents at an early age, Elizabeth was left in the care of a matronly aunt, Cornelia. Now, at twenty, she is a charming young miss. While visiting her cousin, Amanda, she meets Hallock, a wandering artist and musician. Attracted by her loveliness and charm, he forgets his avowed love for her cousin, and becomes infatuated with Elizabeth. Elizabeth's old-fashioned aunt objects to her friendship with a man whose affections are so easily swayed, and forbids her to see him. Piqued at her aunt's objection, Elizabeth continues to see him and he asks her to be his bride. After much pleading, she goes with him to a neighboring town where they are married. Fearing her aunt's ire, she pledges her husband to secrecy. She continues to live at home, while Hallock returns to the city, where he soon forgets his wife. Through an accident, Elizabeth meets and becomes interested in Julian Gerard, a gentleman from New York. Later, at the home of a mutual friend in New York they meet again. Their interest rapidly ripens into love. A prominent artist paints her portrait and when it is shown, she becomes the belle of the season. She goes to many social affairs with Gerard, and at one of them, is seen by her husband, who determines to use her apparent love for Gerard to his own benefit. In sore straits, he demands that she help him socially and financially, holding their marriage over her should she refuse. Elizabeth, unable to meet his demands for money sells her jewels. When she takes the blackmail to him, she is seen by Amanda, who is in Hallock's power. Thinking Elizabeth's relations with Hallock are the same as her own Amanda, in a fierce tirade, upbraids her for coming between them. Gerard, deeply in love with Elizabeth, persistently pleads his suit and is puzzled by her attitude. Although he can see that she loves him, she refuses to give him an affirmative answer, nor will she explain her action. Finally, he demands an explanation and she tells him of her unfortunate marriage. Despondent, he leaves the country to go on a long hunting trip to try and forget his sorrow. Soon after Gerard's departure, Hallock is found dead in his room, with a bottle of poison by his side bearing mute evidence to the cause of death. Elizabeth attracts suspicion to herself by a display of emotion, is taken into custody and held without bail. The trial begins. In connection with other damaging evidence, the testimony of the maid, who heard Elizabeth express a wish for Hallock's death, seems to nullify her chances of acquittal. In London, Gerard reads of the murder and the trial of Elizabeth. He leaves at once for America, where, on his arrival, he gives evidence which sways the case in Elizabeth's favor. After hours of deliberation, the jury returns the verdict of not guilty, and Elizabeth is freed. After the trial she is summoned to the bedside of Amanda in a hospital. Here, with her life blood fast ebbing, Amanda confesses to the murder of Hallock telling of the disgrace and humiliation he had caused her. Her confession finished, her lips are sealed forever by the hand of death. After their marriage, Elizabeth and Gerard leave for a honeymoon in the country, where Elizabeth will have an opportunity to blot the terrible ordeal from her memory.",

Millionaire Ned Beckwith, Olive's former suitor, sees the developing breech and attempts to use it to his advantage by secretly forcing a bank to make Perry repay an $80,000 loan within 24 hours. When Beckwith agrees to Perry's loan request on the condition that he divorce Olive, Perry knocks him down. Olive, vacationing alone in Pasadena, gets word of her husband's straits and sells her jewelry to raise $30,000. Beckwith replies to her request for the rest by inviting her to his apartment that night. Deeply troubled, Olive goes and is saved from Beckwith's seduction when Beckwith's mistress, Marta Holmes, calls Perry, who arrives and fights Beckwith. Marta then kills Beckwith and drowns herself, while the Risdons are reconciled.",
